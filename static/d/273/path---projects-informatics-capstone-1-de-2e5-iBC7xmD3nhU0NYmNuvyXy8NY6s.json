Despite these efforts, there remained a problem: No one knew where this outreach was working and what areas still needed help. Students were falling off the map, programs were unable to collaborate, and the initiative was suffering as a whole.</p>\n<h3>Enter Waypoint</h3>\n<p>Waypoint offers students and partnering organizations a simple information hub for finding and connecting with outreach programs. No longer do students risk the chance of not continuing their involvement, and no longer do organizations have to jump through hurdles just to connect and collaborate with similar offerings in their area of operation.</p>\n<h3>Process as a Product</h3>\n<p>The data that fuels Waypoint was created practically from scratch. We designed a method of data collection for the WWAMI Initiative that enables them to collect clean, extensive information for an ever growing number of outreach programs. As more organizations provide this information, Waypoint will provide a greater wealth of information.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/9076d8ac03bb1adb4d1a500683c0b422/21f61/steps.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 599px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 43.906510851419036%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"steps\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/9076d8ac03bb1adb4d1a500683c0b422/21f61/steps.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/9076d8ac03bb1adb4d1a500683c0b422/a2d06/steps.png 188w,\n/static/9076d8ac03bb1adb4d1a500683c0b422/bb703/steps.png 375w,\n/static/9076d8ac03bb1adb4d1a500683c0b422/21f61/steps.png 599w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a>\n<em>Creating a robust API for accessing the data collected allows future teams to utilize its potential to the fullest</em></p>\n<p>Waypoint was built on the premise that good tools rely on good data.

Through our partner Seattle Data for Good, all of the details of this project and instructions for using the data derived from it will be made available to an entire community of innovators who will continue to help the WWAMI Initiative achieve its goal of eliminating the shortage of physicians in areas of need.</p>\n<h2>My Part</h2>\n<p>Well that sounds cool and all, but you might be thinking \"What exactly did you do, Nathan?\" My role on the team for this project was Designer and Frontend Dev, so in a way, what you see is what I did: graphics (all but one), logos, layout, interaction, ooh and a fancy poster to top it off. Granted, there is more to design and frontend development than just making things look pretty. It's also a matter of knowing the data, working with it, and presenting it in a way that is actually useful to the target audience. </p>\n<h3>Tech I Used</h3>\n<p>As this project was sponsored by non-profits, working with open source technologies was crucial. To such end, I leveraged the following libraries to implement the functionality of the web app.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Material UI: Why mess with success? Sure made the forms a lot easier to implement.</li>\n<li>Leaflet: When Google Maps API requires a credit card on file, you look elsewhere.</li>\n<li>React: Component architecture is life, AMIRIGHT?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/e54444b8cb50440820decc60d841f108/9197c/frontend-tech-info.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 750px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 34.43187407771766%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"frontend tech info\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/e54444b8cb50440820decc60d841f108/9c5b2/frontend-tech-info.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/e54444b8cb50440820decc60d841f108/b3da4/frontend-tech-info.png 188w,\n/static/e54444b8cb50440820decc60d841f108/3057b/frontend-tech-info.png 375w,\n/static/e54444b8cb50440820decc60d841f108/9c5b2/frontend-tech-info.png 750w,\n/static/e54444b8cb50440820decc60d841f108/eb8fc/frontend-tech-info.png 1125w,\n/static/e54444b8cb50440820decc60d841f108/c78db/frontend-tech-info.png 1500w,\n/static/e54444b8cb50440820decc60d841f108/9197c/frontend-tech-info.png 2033w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a>\n<em>The frontend tech stack</em></p>\n<p>Oh yeah, and I made the layout with CSS Grid!</p>\n<h3>The Development Process</h3>\n<p>This project proved to be quite fickle. Half the battle was learning what was required; the other half was showing what was possible. We ran into issues of inconsistent data, missing data, underdeveloped requirements, and general project ambiguity. As a result, a lot of the development of the actual artifact was pushed back much longer than most other capstone teams. I setup what I could in terms of site structure, navigation, general look and feel as well as some of the React components, but we were left feeling behind in terms of what we could physically show for. </p>\n<p>Without even remotely complete data to start with—a simple python analysis I did on the data showed that out of 8,651 data points, there were 6,758 missing entries—starting in on the mapping and filtering aspects of the app proved difficult. To remedy this, I created my own data. Armed with this dummy data, I set about to dynamically putting points on a map and putting that map on a webpage.</p>\n<p>My initial dive down the rabbit hole was with the Google Maps API. Having worked with it previously, I figured it was as good a place as any to start. I didn't get too far in before Google overhauled the whole maps API. After this overhaul, my API key required having billing information on file. Without much of a budget, outside of the cost of rackspace in the UW Data Center, I retreated into the realm of free open source tech.</p>\n<p>I decided to visit an old friend: Leaflet. Being one of the first JavaScript libraries I ever worked with, it felt like coming home: except home had been completely remodeled. That's the way it is with web technologies though. If you leave something for a while, it will keep moving forward and developing without you. Part of being a solid web developer is learning how to quickly adapt to changes and pick new technologies up in a snap—don't worry, not of the Thanos variety.</p>\n<p>Once I had the map working locally with most of the functionality I wanted—more on that in a bit—we put the fake data on the database and hooked up an endpoint that I could retrieve all the data from. Eventually, the real data would live here and no change would be needed on my end. With this behind me, I left the map where it was as an MVP and moved on to the browse and filter requirement.</p>\n<p>Since I took the time in the beginning to create reusable components, this part was a breeze. I extended one component slightly and that was about all it took. I think that's what really sold me on React in the first place: being able to write reusable, extensible html code. Sure, there are plenty other tools that can be used to achieve this, but I started with React, and kinda just kept going with it. The point is, it's never a bad idea to work smarter and not harder.</p>\n<p>I got to the point where I was just waiting for the api endpoint to be all set, so I started checking off the list of \"would be nice to have\" features that we determined in the beginning. One of the biggest ones, and more of something I wanted, was a UX interaction straight out of the Google Maps playbook: click a marker, info card on the side highlights, and vice versa. Seemed easy enough right? Wrong! While working with libraries is ultimately really helpful, it does mean you have to work within the confines of the library. The Leaflet library did not provide the functionality I wanted, and instead of writing an expanded version myself, I decided to cheese it.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"jsx\"><pre class=\"language-jsx\"><code class=\"language-jsx\"><span class=\"token function\">createMarkerIcon</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>program<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> curIcon <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">L<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>Icon</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    iconUrl<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">require</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'../marker.svg'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    iconSize<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">L<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>Point</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token number\">30</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token number\">60</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    className<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'icon'</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> program<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>OrgID<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> curIcon<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n\n  <span class=\"token function\">handleClick</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>orgID<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">setState</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> activeID<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> orgID<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> card <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> document<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">getElementById</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>orgID<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">var</span> iconSelected <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> document<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">getElementsByClassName</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n    <span class=\"token string\">'icon'</span> <span class=\"token operator\">+</span> orgID<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  iconSelected<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">click</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  card<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">scrollIntoView</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    behavior<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'smooth'</span> \n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The solution I came up with, given the time constraints I had, was something that can only be described as one thing: hacky. Don't burn me at the stake for this, but I added a class name to each map marker. Yes, I could have added a id attribute to the marker object, but class name was already there and I had no time left, so I rolled with it. Then it was just a matter of enlisting the help of the trusty <code>document.getElementsByClassName</code>.</p>\n<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>\n<p>Web development isn't always the glamorous act of sitting in a cafe, sipping on some fancy single origin roast while spewing out code into a dark-mode text editor—okay yeah, that was me when I was actually writing the code; what can I say? I like coffee. Web development that truly matters—that provides solutions to real problems for real people—is messy.
