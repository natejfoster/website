No, the more profound the impact of a person, community or place was, the harder it is to say goodbye.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/cae65730dcddcbfd961cf418122fb566/ce8e3/IMG_8068-crop.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; max-height: 1000px !important; max-width: 750px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 70.89643880474826%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"IMG 8068 crop\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/cae65730dcddcbfd961cf418122fb566/f8f3f/IMG_8068-crop.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/cae65730dcddcbfd961cf418122fb566/6e3a5/IMG_8068-crop.jpg 188w,\n/static/cae65730dcddcbfd961cf418122fb566/4c5ed/IMG_8068-crop.jpg 375w,\n/static/cae65730dcddcbfd961cf418122fb566/f8f3f/IMG_8068-crop.jpg 750w,\n/static/cae65730dcddcbfd961cf418122fb566/7b641/IMG_8068-crop.jpg 1125w,\n/static/cae65730dcddcbfd961cf418122fb566/9133f/IMG_8068-crop.jpg 1500w,\n/static/cae65730dcddcbfd961cf418122fb566/ea072/IMG_8068-crop.jpg 2250w,\n/static/cae65730dcddcbfd961cf418122fb566/ce8e3/IMG_8068-crop.jpg 2443w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a>\n<em>Last time leaving the house as a student...for now at least</em></p>\n<p>The goodbyes were to UW and everything that went along with being a student there, although they were drawn out long past graduation. During more or less the last two years of school, I worked at the UW Med Center for Department of Surgery IT. Without a job lined up for after school and grand plans of travelling and climbing, I kept hours on the calendar with Surgery IT to keep a modicum of income. Showing up to campus for work after graduation made it seem like nothing changed. I guess part of me wasn't ready to let go of UW and admit to the change, so I didn't. It's funny, I went so long saying I was ready to be done, and then once I was, being done was the last thing I wanted—to this day, part of me still wishes I was sitting on the 45, rain drizzling down the widows, on my way to campus. Eventually, I came to realize that I needed to let go and move on, so I set my last day of work. </p>\n<p>Needless to say, that day came all to fast. My coworkers took me out to celebrate over pizza and beers, we said our goodbyes, and then it hit me like a train. It was over. I had stepped off of campus as a student for the last time. I was done. I probably looked like a total mess walking up The Ave that day: bleary-eyed, trying my best to hold it together, but failing miserably. </p>\n<p>NEED PHOTO HERE</p>\n<p>I walked all the way home that day. My mind seems to process things the best while walking, so that's what I did. I would have preferred a hike in the woods, but you make do when you need to. What was bothering me wasn't the goodbyes to my coworkers—I'm not always the best at it, but I make it a priority to keep in touch with the people that meant something to me. No, what was bothering me was the end of a chapter of life, and all the things that went along with turning that page. </p>\n<p>When you spend 4 years of your life somewhere, you can't help but become a part of it. You become invested in the communities; you make friends; you find those little hole-in-the-alleyway spots where you spend way too much time and money on coffee—looking at you Cafe Allegro. While I am glad to say I still have my friends, and I can still go to my favorite alleyway coffee shop—although they probably won't remember my order anymore—I had to say goodbye to two communities that had a profound impact on my life: Informatics and The Inn.</p>\n<p>Informatics (TODO)\nI may not have become as invested in the Informatics community as I intended to, but to me it represented finally finding my place in all of whatever this is. After spending almost the first two full years of college feeling like I didn't have a place at UW, the Informatics Community welcomed me in, and made me feel like I belonged somewhere. I spent two years in the program, going to classes with the same people, completing way to many group projects, and staying up way too late too many times trying to debug deployment snags right before the due date. </p>\n<p>The Inn (TODO)</p>\n<h2>Lesson 1: Maintain consistency throughout change.</h2>\n<p>Community and friends</p>\n<h2>Lesson 2: Don't get attached to your plans.</h2>\n<p>Going into my Senior year I had a plan that was foolproof. I was to graduate, take the summer off for all the adventures ever, line up a job during August, and assume my position as a gainfully employed member of society come sometime in September.</p>\n<p>Of course, best laid plans always seem to have a way of falling through, and I guess this time a literal falling wood router would have a thing or two to say about my plans.</p>\n<h2>Injury, Surgery, and Surgery...Again</h2>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/19b34d402a7e91a7deafe01a20a6e2ab/15165/IMG_8403-crop.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative;
