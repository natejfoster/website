Despite these efforts, there remained a problem: No one knew where this outreach was working and what areas still needed help. Students were falling off the map, programs were unable to collaborate, and the initiative was suffering as a whole.</p>\n<h3>Enter Waypoint</h3>\n<p>Waypoint offers students and partnering organizations a simple information hub for finding and connecting with outreach programs. No longer do students risk the chance of not continuing their involvement, and no longer do organizations have to jump through hurdles just to connect and collaborate with similar offerings in their area of operation.</p>\n<h3>Process as a Product</h3>\n<p>The data that fuels Waypoint was created practically from scratch. We designed a method of data collection for the WWAMI Initiative that enables them to collect clean, extensive information for an ever growing number of outreach programs. As more organizations provide this information, Waypoint will provide a greater wealth of information.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/9076d8ac03bb1adb4d1a500683c0b422/21f61/steps.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 599px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 43.906510851419036%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"steps\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/9076d8ac03bb1adb4d1a500683c0b422/21f61/steps.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/9076d8ac03bb1adb4d1a500683c0b422/a2d06/steps.png 188w,\n/static/9076d8ac03bb1adb4d1a500683c0b422/bb703/steps.png 375w,\n/static/9076d8ac03bb1adb4d1a500683c0b422/21f61/steps.png 599w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a>\n<em>Creating a robust API for accessing the data collected allows future teams to utilize its potential to the fullest</em></p>\n<p>Waypoint was built on the premise that good tools rely on good data. Knowing that organizational needs change, we made the database that houses all of the information we've gathered available as its own tool. Through our partner Seattle Data for Good, all of the details of this project and instructions for using the data derived from it will be made available to an entire community of innovators who will continue to help the WWAMI Initiative achieve its goal of eliminating the shortage of physicians in areas of need.</p>\n<h2>My Part</h2>\n<p>Well that sounds cool and all, but you might be thinking \"What exactly did you do, Nathan?\" My role on the team for this project was Designer and Frontend Dev, so in a way, what you see is what I did: graphics (all but one), logos, layout, interaction, ooh and a fancy poster to top it off. Granted, there is more to design and frontend development than just making things look pretty. It's also a matter of knowing the data, working with it, and presenting it in a way that is actually useful to the target audience. </p>\n<h3>Tech I Used</h3>\n<p>As this project was sponsored by non-profits, working with open source technologies was crucial. To such end, I leveraged the following libraries to implement the functionality of the web app.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Material UI: Why mess with success? Sure made the forms a lot easier to implement.</li>\n<li>Leaflet: When Google Maps API requires a credit card on file, you look elsewhere.</li>\n<li>React: Component architecture is life, AMIRIGHT?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Development Process</h3>\n<p>This project proved to be quite fickle. Half the battle was learning what was required; the other half was showing what was possible. We ran into issues of inconsistent data, missing data, underdeveloped requirements, and general project ambiguity. As a result, a lot of the development of the actual artifact was pushed back much longer than most other capstone teams. I setup what I could in terms of site structure, navigation, and general look and feel, but we were left feeling behind in terms of what we could physically show for. </p>\n<p>TODO: redefining the survey and defining scope</p>\n<p>Without even remotely complete data to start with—a simple python analysis I did on the data showed that out of 8,651 data points, there were 6,758 missing entries—starting in on the mapping aspect of the app proved difficult. To remedy this, I created my own data. Armed with this dummy data, I set about to dynamically putting points on a map and putting that map on a webpage.</p>\n<p>My initial dive down the rabbit hole was with the Google Maps API. Having worked with it previously, I figured it was as good a place as any to start. I didn't get too far in before Google overhauled the whole maps API. After this overhaul, my API key required having billing information on file. Without much of a budget outside of the cost of rackspace in the UW Data Center, I retreated into the realm of free open source tech.</p>\n<p>I decided to visit an old friend: Leaflet. Being one of the first JavaScript libraries I ever worked with, it felt like coming home: except home had been completely remodeled. That's the way it is with web technologies though. If you leave something for a while, it will keep moving forward and developing without you. Part of being a solid web developer is learning how to quickly adapt to changes and pick new technologies up in a snap (don't worry, not of the Thanos variety).</p>\n<p>TODO: Finishing map and connecting to the database</p>\n<p>TODO: Tricky ux -> selecting on map selects in sidebar and vice versa.</p>\n<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>\n<p>Web development isn't always the glamorous act of sitting in a cafe, sipping on some fancy single origin roast while spewing out code into a dark-mode text editor—okay yeah, that was me when I was actually writing the code; what can I say? I like coffee. Web development that truly matters—that provides solutions to real problems for real people—is messy. </p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/43ccf1515f8754cdd127e7faf94df287/6afa6/roadmap.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 750px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 9.829351535836178%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAACCAYAAABYBvyLAAAACXBIWXMAAAsTAAALEwEAmpwYAAAAfElEQVQI12MIt+vqZIACd+1ai1jnvvtBFq1OMLHazCVLO8vXvtXlT5cC8TkY3LnqspaeLoqZ0wBT42vU6JLgPuG6h355AUO4LcJAV80ai0iHHhQDq9IWLW0pXPVWizsVbKAqRzRXZcrC0+kBU+EG+hk3uSR6TLzurldeAADSPCnfcZShJgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=='); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"roadmap\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/43ccf1515f8754cdd127e7faf94df287/9c5b2/roadmap.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/43ccf1515f8754cdd127e7faf94df287/b3da4/roadmap.png 188w,\n/static/43ccf1515f8754cdd127e7faf94df287/3057b/roadmap.png 375w,\n/static/43ccf1515f8754cdd127e7faf94df287/9c5b2/roadmap.png 750w,\n/static/43ccf1515f8754cdd127e7faf94df287/eb8fc/roadmap.png 1125w,\n/static/43ccf1515f8754cdd127e7faf94df287/6afa6/roadmap.png 1465w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a>\n<em>Illuminating the path between the dreams of today and the healthcare of tomorrow</em></p>\n<p>Created by: Nathan Foster, Andrew Kan, Govind Pillai and Jon Shilling</p>\n<p>Sponsored by: UW Medicine, WWAMI, Western Washington AHEC, and Seattle Data for Good</p>\n<p><em>Special thanks to Leonora B Clarke (UWSOM), Benjamin Xie (UW iSchool), and Jeremy Caci (UW Undergraduate Affairs)</em></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"UW Informatics Capstone","description":null,"path":"/projects/informatics-capstone","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAAFCAYAAABFA8wzAAAACXBIWXMAAEzlAABM5QF1zvCVAAAA7klEQVQY03WQzWoCMRRGU4UBBREVQelCKBULKlp/WopCt10pOGs3BUHEBxASFFy5KK5dKUpJwBeYAR9OT0Znp4HDd3Pz3XuTCF+roq9lyTcq6hn5iqbZZ9A6pKAGbYjAwjNqj76B9SSgCgVI0utLEGxgCTkSO5qNiOOelluwTVYwBRfGvpH5IKeVay8AM/b/UIahIGEI1mj2VtSHZ+h5miFGDSAGFdgx5M8O4KYvaBO+YcKgIj06gqIuiU/BwuwQv0OLuIX+QAPy9hw9nI7zM4X2eU7gM+rj6ufreLoIF6Yn8WAxPVT+S/7e4sg97wX3Xa8PnoSnEQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==","aspectRatio":4.386058981233244,"src":"/static/0e15716937972c469fe53e358eba0299/2c0ee/logo.png","srcSet":"/static/0e15716937972c469fe53e358eba0299/60beb/logo.png 188w,\n/static/0e15716937972c469fe53e358eba0299/62473/logo.png 375w,\n/static/0e15716937972c469fe53e358eba0299/2c0ee/logo.png 750w,\n/static/0e15716937972c469fe53e358eba0299/ffe07/logo.png 1125w,\n/static/0e15716937972c469fe53e358eba0299/690ab/logo.png 1500w,\n/static/0e15716937972c469fe53e358eba0299/90a27/logo.png 2250w,\n/static/0e15716937972c469fe53e358eba0299/f74b3/logo.png 4908w","sizes":"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{}}
