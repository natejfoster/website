During my junior year of college, I took a class on data visualization. To me, data vis was&mdash;and still is&mdash;this perfect blend of elegant, meaningful design, technical implementation, and analytics. As part of this class, we were to complete a team project as our final. 

I teamed up with Andrew, Jon and Kinsley, and for lack of a better team name, we formed the first ever TeamName&mdash;a joke we would carry with us all the way to our senior year [capstone project](/projects/informatics-capstone).

After spending some time researching cool datasets we could use in our project, we came up with a novel idea: to use the [Google Ngram Dataset](https://books.google.com/ngrams) to explore how language changes and relate it to historical context.

It ended up being a massive project, with git commits right up to the deadline, and while we did get it done, we left it far from where we wanted the project to be. We always talked about revisiting the project, but new school projects took its place, and it receded to the back of our minds, left to accumulate dust and cobwebs. 

With nothing but job apps filling my days, I decided to revisit this project. Only problem, is it's been a while...

## Revisiting an old friend... two years later
When you leave something for two years, it becomes very foreign. Code that I myself had written, I found myself looking at slightly cross-eyed.

How did I do this?

Originally, the plan was to pop the hood, fix some of the bugs, and implement the features we ran out of time for the first time around. After poking around in the code for a bit, I began to realize it would be better to start from scratch&mdash;well, mostly from scratch, as I could still use the data we scraped, the text we wrote, and the research we ended up doing.

With this newfound freedom, I did what any developer might do...

```` bash
$nathanfoster git checkout -b v2
````
