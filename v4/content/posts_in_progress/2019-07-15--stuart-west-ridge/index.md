## Friday
- Stepped at 13:35 after shenanigans that can only happen with such a ruckus crew
- First break at 14:30
- made the pass at 15:05 in 1.5 hrs
- Bug central lake at 16:00
- After making stuart pass, Dave needed to call it, so Nick went with him to leave no man alone.
- Chris and I continued, making the base of the second gully at 18:00
- Topped the gully at 19:30 where we decided to make camp for the night. Boy was that a sweet campsite.
- Had a wonderful evening on the side of the mountain, calling it a night at 22:15. Had service, so I checked in with the family. 

## Saturday
- Started up at 6:20
- Sketchy snow made us glad to have the axes. Made the notch at Long John Tower at 7:05
- After some super rad exposed scrambling, made the west ridge notch at 8:25
- Continued up to the small notch where we crossed from the north back to the south. Roped up here for a short pitch up the cracks and blocky steps. 27 meters maybe. 9:00
- Continued scrambling, descending to the ledge.
- Followed our gut, and found a nice looking set of twin cracks to lead up. Found the fixed piton, and realized we had been perfect in out route finding.
- I took the sharp end, and quickly got into easier terrain. After thinking I'd just belay chris up and scramble the rest, I realized I might as well belay him to the summit register. SUMMIT at 10:25!
- After basking in the moment with an empty summit, started descending at 11:10. Sent a summit selfie to the family.
- So used to nice rock, we dropped to far below the entrance to the cascadian, and had to waste some time going back uphill. Lost maybe 30 or so minutes
- Reached the couloir at 12:55
- Took some time for lunch and water. Started the descending choss questing at 13:15
- Made good time reaching Ingalls Creek Trail at 15:10
- Stopped to filter at the creek at 15:30. Wasted a lot of time with my rubbish filter that decided after being great the first day, did not want to do anything well. Last uphill push started at 16:05
- Both feeling spent, we took an hour to reach longs pass. Took a much needed water and food break, continuing down at 17:10
- Cruised downhill, feeling re-energized, reaching the TH at 18:07
- BBQ and sweet tea in Cle Elem
