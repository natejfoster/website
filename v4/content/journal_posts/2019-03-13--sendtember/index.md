When my surgeon said I could return to normal activity as long as I kept the splint on my finger, I don't think what he had in mind was what I ended up doing in the month of September. I had put a lot on the calendar for the month, and was stubbornly refusing to cancel them, hoping that I'd be good to go. Come mid August, I got the all clear, and well, I hit full send.

What follows is my account of what I have dubbed Sendtember.

PS: If you are thinking to yourself, "Surgeon? What are you talking about?", then give my [2018: A year in review](/journal/2018-a-year-in-review) post a read.

## Labor Day Weekend: Why take it slow?
As part of the Intense Basic Alpine Climbing Course with The Mountaineers&mdash;which I took in 2017, volunteered as a SIG leader for in 2018, and now co-lead&mdash;we have a tradition of spending Labor Day Weekend out at Washington Pass for a weekend of climbing, camping, and shenanigans. I had committed to this weekend of fun before injuring my finger, so I was stoked that I was still going to be able to make it happen&mdash;even if it meant climbing with a splint.

### Poster Peak: Ahh, it's good to be back
Okay, so *technically*, this one was on the last day of August, BUT when you are funemployed, you realize that calendar dates don't really matter that much; all that really matters is what you do with the time given to you. As this climb marked the start of Sendtember, my return to climbing, and my first intermediate level climb with The Mountaineers, it's arguably the most important climb and really can't be left out. 

Blues Buttress is a Grade III, "10" pitch, 5.6 climb that follows the very obvious buttress on the North East side of Poster Peak. While it is reviewed by some on Mountain Project as an unmemorable climb, this climb was definitely worth doing. I probably have a slightly skewed opinion, seeing as it was my first alpine rock climb in quite a few months, but I think there was more to it than that. Following the ridge for the whole climb creates such a stellar aesthetic to the route and yields some truly incredible views&mdash;realistically, all the climbs in the WA Pass area do, *but* they're all slightly different, I promise! 

Rob, Sherrie, Diego, and I planned on climbing the route in groups of two, with the idea of simulclimbing as much as possible. Unfortunately, Sherrie wasn't feeling too well in the morning, so we opted for a party of three with one rope. Sherrie generously gave Rob and I a ride to the hairpin turn where we were meeting Diego, as neither of us had driven out to WA Pass. The three of us started off around 7:00 in the morning from the hairpin turn. The conditions were absolutely glorious: sunny, blue skies with just the right amount of clouds, and a gentle breeze. Under the favorable conditions, we made short work of the approach, making it to the base of the climb in under an hour. 

A family of goats guarded the entrance to the climb, forcing us to take a longer break before starting up the route. Once the goats were done playing Gandalf, we started up the route, Rob taking the first lead. While none of the climbing was particularly difficult, being able to keep moving on low fifth class terrain was such a treat. Rob got us up to the crux pitch, which is advertised as a 5.6 but I would definitely classify it as a 5.7. We decided to set a belay for this section and Diego took the sharp end. Once we were up this section, we returned to simuling until Diego ran out of gear, leaving the sharp end to me.

I was a little nervous going into this as it was my first trad lead since the injury, I still had a splint on, and I knew there was a section of 5.6 ahead of me. I chatted with the guys, and decided I would go as far as I could, but if I was ever uncomfortable, I would build an anchor and let one of them take the lead again&mdash;as if! The climbing was so much fun, and before I realized it, I had cruised through the 5.6 section, and was down to my last few pieces of gear. Reluctantly, I built an anchor and belayed the others up so we could recollect the gear. I decided to let Rob finish up the route so we could *technically* "swing leads" with Diego in the middle in the interest of being a little more efficient. 

Soon enough, we were at the top, and I had my first alpine rock summit since injuring my finger about 2 months earlier.

We made it back to the base of the climb in 20 minutes via part walk-off, part screeing&mdash;think skiing with your approach shoes on small loose rock. After recollecting our stashed gear, we headed towards the car, with the allure of a cold beverage in town to cap off the day quickening our pace. We popped out of the bushes that line the hairpin turn just before 2pm, marking a 7 hour car-to-car time, without even trying. It was good to back.

The three of us piled into Diego's Fiat, and headed back to camp to meet up with the rest of the crew. A little over an hour later, we were enjoying some ice cold brews and resetting to do it all again the next day.

### Cutthroat Peak: Well, that was awkward...
Looming across Highway 20 from the Liberty Bell group, Cutthroat stands for all to see. Whereas the summits of the Blue Lake side are spires&mdash;admittedly tall spires&mdash;Cutthroat is a proper mountain. Originally, this day was supposed to be a climb of something called The Fin, a lesser know, but appropriately named, fin of rock past Kangaroo Temple. Due to limited beta on The Fin, we decided to switch to Cutthroat, as Sherrie, our climb leader, had descended via the route we would ascend: The West Ridge. 

We started our day around 6:00am. Below Cutthroat, lies an alpine meadow basin that is somewhere one could spend a lot of time doing a lot of nothing (*subtle foreshadowing*). While the trail to this basin was steep, it was in fact a trail and made this part of the approach straightforward. After the basin, however, the trail turns into what you would expect climbing a mountain in Ze Alpine: steep, loose, choss. This slowed us down, but we were still making decent time. We got to the base of the ridge, and geared up to start climbing.

Because of some last minute roster changes, Michael ended up trailing two ropes and belayed both Sherrie and Amber up, and Seth and I took second in line. Michael set off, taking a slightly wandering route&mdash;not that I can blame him, the gear was hard to come by unless you went looking for it. After a pitch and a mini one, Michael and his team made it to the anchor station, with me right behind. Armed with the beta of which way not to go and a rope that was 10 meters longer than Michael's, I made the anchor in one pitch and put Seth on belay.

After the gear transition, I started up the next section, which at the time, I hardly would have called a pitch. It was a short, maybe 15 foot rise to another set of bolts. There looked to be only about three moves between me and the mellow friction scramble to the anchor...

Okay, so before I get into the awkward part, a bit of background info is needed. Throughout my recovery from the surgery, I had something like 6 different splints made. Each time something changed&mdash;the sutures came out, the wound healed, the pin was removed&mdash;the splint would get smaller. The splint I had when I headed out to WA Pass, was just a tad too long. If I gripped something, the splint would bind on my finger and be slowly pushed off. In my state of stoke to be back climbing, I didn't consider the implications of this, if I were to... uh... grip down a little to quickly on a hold.

So there I was, right foot flagged out on a tiny smear, left hand with the finger splint on a sloper (I hate slopers even without a splint mind you), and right hand trying to plug a cam in the least flaring portion of the only crack to put pro in. I hadn't quite seated the cam, when my right foot decided it didn't want to continue holding onto the rock. With my balance no longer provided through the right foot, I started barn-dooring until the cam would have caught since I was still holding onto it. Of course I was holding onto it, because I was still placing it, so naturally the cam popped and my barn door manuever continued. In a last ditch effort, I flagged my right foot behind me to the left to brace against the rock and bared down on my left hand. I held on, but, well, my splint did not.

My rapid shift in grip shot my splint right off of my finger. It bounced off of the rock and launched over my shoulder, careening down towards Seth. "MY SPLINT!" I yelled. After Seth realized what was coming towards him was a small piece of moulded plastic and not a rock, he reached out to attempt a catch, but the unpredictable trajectory of a falling splint thwarted him and continued down the mountain, never to be seen again.

After collecting myself and not wanting to risk anything with my no longer splinted finger, I calmly called out to Michael who was no more than 10 feet above me coiling his rope.

"Hey bud, you mind throwing me an end of your rope?"  
"Uhh sure... What's up?"  
"My splint, it's um, somewhere down there now."  
"Ah, yes. That's a problem."  

Michael threw me an end and put me on belay as I tied in. I clambered up the last 10 feet, and after bringing Seth up. Michael and I set about fabricating a splint. A small twig, a bit of gauze, and a lot of tape, and my finger was happy in a cocoon of questionable quality. This is gonna be fun to explain to my surgeon when I get back...

With my finger in a less than protected state, a sizable amount of climbing to go, and our turnaround time rapidly approaching, we made the call to save the summit for another day. After enjoying the views and lunch from our summit for the day, we began our rappels, making sure to keep our eyes peeled for my real splint just in case. With no luck, we packed our climbing gear away and started down the choss.

In interest of finding a better way down than we came up, we wandered skier's right of our ascent route. To our happy surprise, we found some semblance of a trail which took us down past the scrambly bit and into some wondrous screeing that got us back to the alpine basin in no time.

Since the screeing was much more sandy on this trip than Poster Peak, we took a break on a big flat rock to empty out our shoes. We all took the opportunity to grab some snacks and water as well. I'm not sure who made the first move, but between the comfort of no shoes, the tasty treats, and the beautiful weather, soon enough we were all lounging, basking in the warm rays of the sun. 


- dump the shoes into nap time
- descent to beers!

### Heather-Maple Pass Loop: The attempted rest day
This hike had sat on my todo list for quite some time, so when Nick, Elizabeth, and Olivia said we should take a rest day and go hiking instead, I was sold.

### Black Peak: Icing on the cake
Not gonna lie, the night before this outing, I was NOT AT ALL STOKED. 
## Team YKK: The sewing begins
Back in June during Intense Basic 2018, Michael and I had plotted a grand adventure up to Squamish.
