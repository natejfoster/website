Is it already that time again?


## New Beginnings? New Freaking Beginnings!
Last year, I ended my recap, sparknotes, TLDR&mdash;okay, yeah it was a 20 minute read, but that is much less than the 525,600 minutes it took to live it&mdash;[post](/journal/2018-a-year-in-review) by posing a question:

> *New beginnings?*

Honestly, when I wrote that section, it came from a place of hope and not much else. The second half of 2018 had not been anything like I wanted, and in some sense, I think it was me challenging 2019 to be better. To quote my early 2019 self,

> "...truthfully, I am pretty stoked for 2019. I might not know *where* I'll be working or *what* crazy adventures I'll go on this year, but it's gonna be rad."

When your point of comparison is a year that ended with Thanksgiving in a hospital and a month long IV treatment, it's hard not to want something new for the next one&mdash;to be hopeful that it's gonna be rad, even in the face of some pretty big unknowns. It's surreal looking back at what I wrote then, knowing what I know now&mdash;that while 2019 held some extremely low points, it had some some crazy adventures in store for me and one new beginning that changed... well... everything. But I am getting ahead of myself, so let's start at the top.
